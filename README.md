# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

These are my solutions to exercises from _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_. The book's PDF is available [here](https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf).

## Running the examples

`mit-scheme` can be found [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/).

On macOS, the easiest way is to probably use `homebrew`:

```bash
brew install mit-scheme
```

Then run:

```bash
cd ch-1/
mit-scheme --quiet < ex-1-36.scm
```
